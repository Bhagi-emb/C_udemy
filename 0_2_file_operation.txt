    FILE *fopen(const char *filename, const char *mode);	
    Opens a file in the specified mode. Returns a file pointer.
fclose()	
    int fclose(FILE *stream);	
    Closes an open file. Returns 0 on success, EOF on failure.
fgetc()	
    int fgetc(FILE *stream);	
    Reads a character from the file. Returns EOF if end of file is reached.
fgets()	
    char *fgets(char *str, int n, FILE *stream);	
    Reads a string from the file up to n-1 characters or until a newline is encountered.
fputc()	
    int fputc(int ch, FILE *stream);	
    Writes a character to the file. Returns the character written.
fputs()	
    int fputs(const char *str, FILE *stream);	
    Writes a string to the file. Returns a non-negative number on success.
fread()	
    size_t fread(void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);	
    Reads binary data from a file into memory.
fwrite()	
    size_t fwrite(const void *ptr, size_t size, size_t count, FILE *stream);	
    Writes binary data from memory to a file.
fprintf()	
    int fprintf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);	
    Writes formatted output to a file.
fscanf()	
    int fscanf(FILE *stream, const char *format, ...);	
    Reads formatted input from a file.
feof()	
    int feof(FILE *stream);	
    Checks if the end of file is reached. Returns nonzero if EOF is reached.
fseek()	
    int fseek(FILE *stream, long offset, int whence);	
    Moves the file pointer to a specific location.
ftell()	
    long ftell(FILE *stream);	
    Returns the current position of the file pointer.
rewind()	
    void rewind(FILE *stream);	
    Moves the file pointer to the beginning of the file.
remove()	
    int remove(const char *filename);	
    Deletes a file. Returns 0 on success, nonzero on failure.
rename()	
    int rename(const char *oldname, const char *newname);

fflush()	
    int fflush(FILE *stream);	
    Flushes the output buffer of a file.

/*FILE MODES*/
Summary:
"r" → Read only (fails if file does not exist).
"w" → Write only (erases file if it exists).
"a" → Append only (does not erase).
"r+" → Read + Write (fails if file does not exist).
"w+" → Read + Write (erases file if it exists).
"a+" → Read + Append (does not erase).
